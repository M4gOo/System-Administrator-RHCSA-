Divide a storage device is called partitioning

check partitions in linux
lsblk 
to be a partition in the output must show part ion the type column
virtual machines storages devices typically begin with V
s SATA
nvme  NVMe


sudo fdisk --list /dev/sda

fdisk pre installed partitioning utility. This command shows a list of partitions on this block
storage devices is divided into sectors
check the partition  and with the number in start column multiple with the sector size it will have the Sectors column which will be the size, this
means that the partition has the size of free space before that sectors 0 to 2047 (2047 for example is the number shown in the Start column)
it is good to leave at least 1G free for bootloader in case needs to be install in that area. This method is MBR


Create a partition --------------------------------------
sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb

GPT less likely to be corrupted and many more primary partitions and use much larger partitions
gpt = gpt
dos = mbr

can select swap space


Configure and manage swap space =================================================

swap area wher linux can temporarily move some data from the computer RAM
when you open a program and it is just there doing nothin and you want to open a browser, even doesnt have enough memory, linux
will move the memory used in the program, which you havent done much, and move the memory to swap partition.

to check if the system uses any kindof swap areas
swapon --show

to make a partition be a swap area
sudo mkswap /dev/vdb3   (check first with the command lsblk)
sudo swapon --verbose /dev/vdb3

But if you reboot the system the partition wont be used as swap
sudo swapoff /dev/vdb3   stop using the partition as swap
create a  file with empty zeros
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=128 status=progress
dd will copy the if file to of, count means to qrite 1 megabyte block 128 times. it will be 128Megabytes

make sure so set proper permissions
sudo chmod 600 /swap

then
sudo  mkswap /swap
sudo swapon --verbose /swap
