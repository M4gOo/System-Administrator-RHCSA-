Boot, reboot, and shutdown a system safely===================================================


systemctl - system control

sudo systemctl reboot
sudo systemctl poweroff

sudo systemctl reboot --force
sudo systemctl poweroff --force

to "press" reset button
sudo systemctl reboot --force --force

"unplug" the system
sudo systemctl poweroff --force --force

to schedule a time to reboot or/and shutdown
sudo shutdown 02:00   (2am)
sudo shutdown +15     in 15min shutdown
sudo shutdown -r 02:00    reboot -r
sudo shutdown -r +15      reboot in 15min
sudo shutdown -r +1 'Shceduled restart to do an offline-backup of our database'  -  single quotes, message to tell the user a message before reboot/shutdown


Boot or change system into different operating modes===================================================

to check our default boot
systemcl get-default
graphical.target

sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target  
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target  (temporary gives a graphical prompt, after reboot back to the default you set to boot)
sudo systemctl isolate emergency.target   (for troubleshooting, read permissions, few system are loaded). You must have root password
sudo systemctl isolate rescue.target      (root permission, there will be more programs than emergency). You must have root password



Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system ===========================================================
