configuring SSH servers and clients

configuration file
/etc/ssh/sshd_config      (sshd -> the D means daemon)   man sshd_config
/etc/ssh/ssh_config       (this is the config file for client, no D)


/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  can change the port number
  can change the AddressFamily, this can change for ipv4, ipv6 or both (look at man page and search for Family)
  can change ListernAddress, so you can specify a IP addr to listen
  can change PermitRootLogin, this case you can login as a root using ssh service
  can change the PasswordAuthentication, this case choosen no, only ssh keys it will be possible to login
  can change the x11forwarding - start a remote app and forwarding to you local machine to interact
  
For example disable passwordauthentication global, but if you want do an exemption for an user add below PasswordAuthentication
Match User <username>
      PasswordAuthentication yes
      
After change need to reload to apply the new changes
sudo systemctl reload sshd.service


For the client we can add a file under ~/.ssh/config, change the permission chmod 600 config
inside this file we can add host with informations
  Host centos
        Hostname <IP>
        Port 22
        User <username>
 
 then you can use only ssh centos  to access the host/server
 
 To use ssh keys, generate keys in the client
 ssh-keygen
 
 then copy the public key to the server
 ssh-copy-id username@IP
 
 to remove fingerprint from a specific server saved in the known host
 ssh-keygen -R <IP>
 
 when you login using ssh, the client has some default config file
 /etc/ss/ssh_config
 this is not a good practice to make change in this file because future upgrade of the 
 ssh client it might overwrite the changes, better way is to modify in 
 /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/<name_of_conf_file>
 then you can add new port, for example
