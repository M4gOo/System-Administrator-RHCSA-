================================================ TUNED
Sysadmins can use the static profiles to define specific performance parameters or allow the system to switch profiles dynamically depending on the existing workload.
A profile is a set of rules that defines certain system parameters such as disk settings, kernel parameters, network optimization settings, and many other aspects of the system.


================================================ systemd targets
Targets in systemd act as synchronization points during the start of your system.
The purpose of target units is to group together various systemd units through a chain of dependencies.
The graphical.target unit for starting a graphical session, starts system services such as the GNOME Display Manager (gdm.service) or Accounts Service (accounts-daemon.service), 
and also activates the multi-user.target unit.

systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default
ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/system/

basic
unit target covering basic boot-up

rescue
unit target that pulls in the base system and spawns a rescue shell

multi-user
unit target for setting up a multi-user system

graphical
unit target for setting up a graphical login screen

emergency
unit target that starts an emergency shell on the main console. provides the most minimal environment possible and allows you to repair your system even 
in situations when the system is unable to enter rescue mode. In emergency mode, the system mounts the root file system only for reading, 
does not attempt to mount any other local file systems, does not activate network interfaces, and only starts a few essential services.

sysinit
unit target that pulls in the services required for system initialization


=============================================== niceness value
Niceness value is a number attached to processes in *nix systems  by the kernel process scheduler to calculate a process' 
'true priority'â€”which is used to decide how much CPU time is allocated to it.
