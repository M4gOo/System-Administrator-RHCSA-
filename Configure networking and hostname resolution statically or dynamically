if the host need to access the internet, it will need a gateway and DNS.
Host wants to access google, it will ask DNS resolver what is the IP addr for google, then
DNS gives the IP-google so the host can connect to the google. Now the host can talk to the gateway
like I want this data to reach to IP-google, then the gateway sends it out from our network
to another network until reach the destination

dynamically  settings are from a service like DHCP
manually we need to set up the IP

first look for the name of the network
ip link show      OR      ip l
output it will be sometime like
enp0s3:....

different network interface, with more info
ip addresses show    OR    ip a
enp0s3:....
inet IPv4

network cards that use wire start with letter E, wirelless with W 

IPv4 - 32bits
IPv6 - 128bits

routing table
ip route show     OR    ip r
ip addr via default gateway
the output it will something like
default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s3 ...
the default getway it will be what is show above

to see the DNS that the system is currently using
/etc/resolv.conf
the output it will something like
nameserver 192.168.1.1

nameserver it will be always a valid DNS resolver, it is normal see two or more listed here,
those are for backups

static DNS
sudo /etc/hosts


centOS it will configure waht is inside this file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
inside the file you see the different network adapter, choose one and it will show
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
this means it is auto configured
for static change dhcp for none
 in RH distros a program called network manager is the default or managing anything.
 
 2 usefull tools network manager has

 nmtui - network manager text user interface
 usually is installed by default, if not use dnf package
 sudo nmtui
 it will show another window wher eyou can configure the network inteface
 configure the DNS, Gateway, IPv4 + subnet if you choose manually
 to apply the configuration reboot or
 sudo nmcli device reapply enps03
 
 
 
 Configure network services to start automatically at boot ==============================================================================
 
 if the network manager is not working it wont have ips, gateways and so on
 check the network manager, mus be enabled
 systemctl status NetworkManager.service
 
 to install
 dnf install NetworkManager
 
 
 another way to enable nmcli at boot is 
 nmcli connection show  (take note of the name connection)
 sudo nmcli connection modify <name=enp0s3> auto connect yes



Start, stop, and check the status of network services =======================================================================================
SS  - modern tool
Netstat


sudo ss -tunlp  
-l : listening means ready to accept an incoming connection
-t : tcp connections
-u : udp connections
-n: numeric values, we get port number
-p: processes is envolved, with p flag needs sudo priv

ss -ltun    without p it will show the service name instead of port number

the output will have some 
Netid  State    Recv-Q   Send-Q     Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port  Process                                                                        
udp    UNCONN   0        0          127.0.0.1:323             0.0.0.0:*      users:(("chronyd",pid=684,fd=13))                                     
udp    UNCONN   0        0                0.0.0.0:22            0.0.0.0:*      users:(("ssh",pid=1249,fd=7))                                                                              
udp    UNCONN   0        0                   [::]:53198             [::]:*      users:(("avahi-daemon",pid=921,fd=15))                                        
tcp    LISTEN   0        128                [::1]:631               [::]:*      users:(("cupsd",pid=1092,fd=6))    

127.0.0.1:323  - the program is listning for incoming connections from the system itself, but no from other computers
0.0.0.0:22  - it will accept connections from any external IP addr
[::]:53198 - this means same as 0.0.0.0, but listening for connections from IPv6
[::1]:631 - this means same as 127.0.0.1, but listening for connections from IPv6


in this table you can see the PID, with that we can check the pid and the files that are open by this process
ps  <pid>
sudo lsof -p <pid>



Implement packet filtering ===========================================================================================================
